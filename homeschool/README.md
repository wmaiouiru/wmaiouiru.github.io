# Motivation
- Education should be self-paced
- Eduaction should be customized and catered (ideally self-guided by the student)
- Time spent on education should be optimized for quality
  - Personally I had too many variety and could have used more depth given what I know now.
- Feedback should be fast and in-depth
- Failure/mistakes should be learning oppertunity to re-try. Current education system is really just one time cadence
- Outcome and records should be digitized to allow exploration as a data vault
